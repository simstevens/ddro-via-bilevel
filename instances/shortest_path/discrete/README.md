# Shortest Path instances

## MPS files for solving with MibS
The `.mps` and `.aux` files in this repository can be used to solve the corresponding shortest path instance with `MibS`. 

## QLP files for solving with Yasol
The `.qlp` files in this repository can be used to solve the corresponding shortest path instance with `Yasol`. 

The files named `*_existeval.qlp` correspond to Model 1 in the paper. 
The files named `*_bilevel.qlp` correspond to Model 2 in the paper.
The files named `*_implicit.qlp` correspond to a third formulation that models the bilinearities with an implicit reformulation.
